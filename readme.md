## ASQN beta 1.0
Structured quasi-Newton method for solving optimization with orthogonality constraint:
\[\min_X f(X)\;  s.t. \; X^{\top}X = I_p, \]
where X is a n-by-p matrix. 

- The current version can be only used to solve problems from the electronic structure calculation and linear eigenvalue problem. However, it can be easily revised for other problems.


## The electronic structure calculation
The code can cover the following two variants:  
  * Kohn-Sham total energy minimization 
  * Hartree-Fock total energy minimization
  
 Running the codes requires a new version of the KSSOLV package [3]. Due to the copyright issues, KSSOLV is not provided.

## Linear eigenvalue problems
 The problem is:
 \[\min \mathrm{Tr}(X^{\top}(A+B)[X]), s.t., X^{\top}X =I_p, \]
 where, $A$ and $B$ are two linear operators or matrices, the computatioal cost of $B[X]$ is much higher than that of $A[X]$.
